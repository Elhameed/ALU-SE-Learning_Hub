# ALU Software Engineering Resources

Welcome to the ALU Software Engineering Resources repository! This repository contains a curated list of resources that we believe will help our colleagues studying Software Engineering at the African Leadership University to better understand the concepts.

Our collection includes a range of resources, from introductory guides to more advanced topics, as well as links to tutorials, videos, articles, and other learning materials. Whether you're just starting out in your software engineering studies or looking to deepen your knowledge in a specific area, we hope you'll find something here that can help.
