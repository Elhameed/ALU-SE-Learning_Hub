# ALU Software Engineering Resources

Welcome to the ALU Software Engineering Learning Hub repository! This repository contains a curated list of resources that is directed at helping those of us studying Software Engineering at the African Leadership University to better understand the concepts.

The collection includes a range of resources, from introductory guides to more advanced topics, as well as links to tutorials, videos, articles, and other learning materials. Whether you're just starting out in your software engineering studies or looking to deepen your knowledge in a specific area, I hope you'll find something here that can help.
