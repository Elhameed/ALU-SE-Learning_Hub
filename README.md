# ALU Software Engineering Resources - Sept2022

Welcome to the ALU Software Engineering Resources repository for September 2022! This repository contains a curated list of resources that we believe will be helpful for ALU students studying software engineering. Our goal is to provide a centralized hub where students can find a variety of materials to support their learning and deepen their understanding of key software engineering concepts. 

Our collection includes a range of resources, from introductory guides to more advanced topics, as well as links to tutorials, videos, articles, and other learning materials. Whether you're just starting out in your software engineering studies or looking to deepen your knowledge in a specific area, we hope you'll find something here that can help.

We'll be updating the repository regularly to add new resources and ensure that everything remains up-to-date and relevant. If you have suggestions for additional resources or topics that you'd like to see covered, please feel free to submit a pull request or reach out to us directly.
