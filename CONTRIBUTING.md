### Instructions on how to get started 

- In order to Contribute to the repo, please look out for the section in the repo that matched your area of interest. then add the links or book link to that. If the area does not  exist, please create the new section and then add your work. 
- One philosophy used in this list while contributing is that link should directly point to videos for viewing/downloading than registration and waiting for the next session. If videos are directly accessible through the platform/YouTube or any other source, please use the direct source.
